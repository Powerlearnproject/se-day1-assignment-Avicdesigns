Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry

 the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications.
 modern business landscape by providing organizations with the capacity to rapidly upscale their IT infrastructure and develop high-quality, reliable software solutions, thereby enhancing operations, optimizing processes, and driving greater efficiency
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

development of programming language
esablishmen of sofware engineering descipline
use of agile methologie
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
requirements 
Design 
Implementation 
Testing 
Deployment 
Maintenance 



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Water Fall;Has sequential approach with distinct  phases While Agile has incremental approach  with  flexibility  and easy to change 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Softwares developer :Responsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurance  Engineer:Planning and test plan
Project Manager:Planning,Excision and delivery of Software projects 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Provide comprehensive tool for debugging and  testing. Codes eg Vs(IDES)
Tracking changes vto source code and coordinate work with teams e.g Git (VCS)


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Inadequate capital __Proper budgeting
Inadequate Research __Use of modern tech


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

. Unit testing is the process of checking small pieces of code to ensure that the individual parts of a program work properly on their own ...
Integration testing involves checking individual components or units of a software project to expose defects and problems to verify that they work together as designed.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models' training data.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"What do you do next?" "Where are you supposed to go?"
